with basically the same functionality except without the Google accounts and all that stuff yet

So no syncing, no OAuth, maybe no notifications yet for now

Some things may be implemented differently while in this phase but it'll be redone when Google
is being implemented

So far it's still a mess because I've been working on different parts

The header is pretty much there but the buttons on it can be fixed easily once the pages they
lead to are actually made.

Login is done but it won't be the same as the final one because that'll be "Sign in with Google"

checking for violation
